# Predicting-a-Player-s-position-based-on-the-attributes
Predicting a Playerâ€™s position based on the attributes Using the data, create a model that accurately predicts/assigns a players position based on the individual attributes. The following steps should be clearly elucidated: 1. Data Cleaning 2. Features considered for EDA and further steps. 3. Exploratory Data Analysis Undertaken 4. Inference from EDA 5. Choice of Best Algorithm and Why 6. Training Accuracy 7. Predictions with test data
